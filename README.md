# spotify-cli

To run the provided Python script, follow these steps:

Install Required Packages:
Ensure you have the necessary packages installed. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```pip install spotipy```


Update Spotify API Credentials:
Replace the placeholder values for `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` with your actual Spotify API credentials. You can obtain these by creating a Spotify Developer account and registering a new application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

Run the Script:
Save the Python script with a .py extension, for example, spotify_cli.py. Open a terminal in the directory where the script is saved and run:

```python spotify_cli.py```

Follow the prompts in the terminal. Enter the name of a song to search and play it. Type 'exit' to quit the application.

Please note that the script relies on user input, so it's important to provide valid input, and you need an internet connection to interact with the Spotify API.

Additionally, keep in mind that this is a basic CLI application, and the actual playback functionality might not work as expected on all systems due to the limitations of certain operating systems and environments.
